Rules Engine Tech Interview.

** Problem:

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE markdown
  # Cytora - python take home test
  ## Context

  Cytora provides software to insurers to help them manage, classify,
  and route risks (insurance opportunities). Part of that involves
  making decisions like:

  - Which office or group should handle this risk
  - What products are appropriate for this risk
  - Whether the risk can be reasonably/profitably insured

  One of the main mechanisms we use to do this is a rules engine that operates on
  both submitted and inferred data to apply boolean flags (segment tags) to each risk submission.

  ## Problem

  Your task will be to implement a simplified rules engine.

  ### Final State

  We want to be able to express rules like this:

  ```
  Either:
    credit_rating is above 50
    AND
    flood_risk is below 10
  OR
    revenue is above 1000000
  ```

  ### Requirements

  These rules need to be configurable and variable in several ways:
  - The number of comparisons
  - The variables referenced (e.g. replacing `credit_rating` with something else)
  - The constant values being compared against
  - The operators being used (e.g. greater than, less than, equals)
  - The structure of the boolean composition (i.e where AND/OR/etc are, and where the parentheses are)

  ### Implementation

  We need to be able to apply them to input that looks like this:

  ```python
  EXAMPLE_1 = {
      "credit_rating": 75,
      "flood_risk": 5,
      "revenue": 1000
  }
  ```

  In this case, you would produce an output like:

  ```python
  True
  ```

  You need to come up with an appropriate configurable representation
  for rules like the ones above, express that specific ruleset in your
  representation, and write a program to apply these rules to various
  test inputs.

  Important: It is up to you how to represent the rules but you DO NOT
  need to implement any code to turn "text" into such representation!

  The whole solution might look like:

  ```python

  EXAMPLE_1 = {...}

  RULE = ...

  def evaluate(rule, data):
    ...

  print(evaluate(RULE, EXAMPLE_1))

  ```

  ## Notes
  - Use python3
  - If you decided to use any dependencies that are not part of the standard library, please explain why.
  - If you make any assumptions, call them out explicitly

  Rule:
  '\nEither:\n  credit_rating is above 50\n  AND\n  flood_risk is below 10\nOR\n  revenue is above 1000000\n'

  Is represented as:

  Or(rules=(And(rules=(Rule(a='credit_rating', b=50, operator=<Operator.greater_than: <built-in function gt>>), Rule(a='flood_risk', b=10, operator=<Operator.less_than: <built-in function lt>>))), Rule(a='revenue', b=1000000, operator=<Operator.greater_than: <built-in function gt>>)))

  Using the following data, should evaluate as: True

  {'credit_rating': 75, 'flood_risk': 5, 'revenue': 1000}

  Evaluation: True
